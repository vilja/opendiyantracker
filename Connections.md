#New connections....
The pics are self explanatory, but here it goes:

# Tx Side #

The orange wire carries the signal to the audio IN of your video Tx (black is ground and only connected in one side), the orange disk is a ceramic capacitor marked 473 (47nF) so far it is the value that works better.

EDIT: I am trying now this instead of the above (the above work well, but I notice some banding in the video, thus the change):

Pay attention to the audio level of the Arduino output in order to not saturate audio input of your video Tx.

Use a GND --1.8kOhm --|--8.2KOhm--pin10

Power from the lipo to the RAW pin of the arduino and also the ground (bear in mind common ground and ONLY effective connection to Ground -avoid ground loops-), the green wire brings the gps signal, in this case 9600bps, but you have to adapt t your gps unit change it in the code also).

Fixed to the TS with double side foam.

One winch servo for PAN (Servo GWS S125 1T de 360ยบ or other) and a regular Futaba F148 (or equivalent)  for TILT.
All ready to roll.
